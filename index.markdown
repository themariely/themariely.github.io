# Introduction

In this page, we will conduct an analysis of the variation in drug and narcotics incident reports in San Francisco across the majority of the first two decades of the 21st century. 
Drug and narcotics incident occurrences are related to illegal drugs or controlled substances (consumption, manufacturing, distributions, etc). For this analysis we are using a data set obtained from https://datasf.org/opendata/, which contains all crimes occurences reported to San Francisco Police Department from 2003 until the first few months of 2018.

As of 2020, 700K drug overdose deaths have been reportted in the US since 2000 (https://drugabusestatistics.org/).


# Exploring the data

The graph 1 displays the number of drug and narcotics incidents reported in San Francisco from 2003 to 2017. Graphs 2, 3 and 4 show the number of the same type of incidents reported in the worst neighbourhoods for this category. The number of incidents reported has been decreasing since 2003, with a slight increase in 2015. The number of incidents reported in 2018 is the lowest in the period analyzed.

We can see from the picture displayed that Tenderloin is the neighborhood with the highest number of drug and narcotics incidents reported in San Francisco. This is followed by South of Market and Mission. Although the number of incidents in Tenderloin is significantly higher than in the other neighborhoods, the trend in the number of incidents is similar across all neighborhoods. The number of incidents reported in Tenderloin is decreasing, while the number of incidents in South of Market and Mission is increasing.
