title: San Francisco's struggle with drugs and narcotics
---

Throughout the years San Fransisco has been in a battle with drugs and crime. According to the [National Institute on Drug Abuse](https://drugabusestatistics.org/), drug overdose deaths have been increasing each year in the US since 1999, where over 700,000 drug overdose deaths have been reported. As late as the 2. Feb 2024  New York Times states that "San Fransisco is in the middle of a drug crisis" [reference]. As the influence of drugs in San Fransico is non-negociable, this page will inevstigate how the social situation is reflected in the police reporting of the Police Department from 2003 to 2017. 

The dataset is obtained from [DataSF](https://datasf.org/opendata/) containing all crime occurrences in San Fransisco over this period. The incidents on drugs and narcotics are extraced and analysed which include incidents related to illegal drugs or controlled substances and may include manufacturing, distribution, possession, and trafficking, amongst others. The dataset contains information about the type of crime, the date and time it occurred, the police district where it occurred, and the latitude and longitude of the location where it occurred and mode. This information will be used to to shed light on the social situation in San Fransisco from an other point of view

# San Fransisco in districts

San Fransisco has 10 districts spanning over 121 kilometers and is the home of 808 437 residents [reference]. It is common knowledge that districts within a city have different characteristics, especially in a city as big as San Fransisco. Hence the number of drugs/narcotic-related reportings in each year is illustrated in the figure below on the left where the instance location is color-coded according to the district. The three districts with the highest drug-related repotings are highlighted on the right of the figure representing Tenderloin, South and Mission respectively.

*Plot 1: The barplot displays the count of DRUG/NARCOTICS crime reports in San Francisco from 2003 to 2017; Plot 2-4: The barplots display the count of DRUG/NARCOTICS crime reports in Tenderloin, Southern and Mission, respectively, from 2003 to 2017*

From the main figure is seen a general trend where the umber of incidents reported has been decreasing since 2003, with a peak in 2015. The number of incidents reported in 2017 is the lowest in the period analyzed. Tenderloin is the neighborhood with the highest number of drug and narcotics incidents reported. This is followed by South of Market and Mission. Although the number of incidents in Tenderloin is significantly higher than in the other neighborhoods, the trend in the number of incidents is similar across all neighborhoods. 

# What types of drug?

The trend of the police reportings contrasts the perceived presence of an increasing drug problem in the media. The reporting instances are therefore categorized by drug type to see if the trend is caused by a specific drug. The most recurring instance descriptions were investigated to make a list of the most popular drugs including the categories "" referring to drug related equipment and "Other". Each instance was sorted into a category according the the drug name contained in the description. The evolution of the police reporting for each 6 months after the year 2003  is illustrated in the following interactive plot categorized by drug type.

It is clear that Cocain has been the most dominant drug in circulation with a trend similar to the trend of the overall drug reportings.  Narcotic paraphernalia and other drug related offences also follow the trend with a smaller magnitude and a smaller peak in 2010 compared to cocain. As the specification of the narcotic paraphernalia and the other offences are unknown it one can not reject the possibility that these categories are a consequence of the cocain related consumption. The other categories show a more stable evolution with a slight negative slope.

# Outside factors

It has not been possible to uncover the reasoning behind the drug related reporting trends through the data solely. To understand the evolution one must be critical towards the datasource and look for external information to support or disprove theories. The data used shows only the reported incidens and does not reflect the actual activity of drug consumption in San Fransisco. Despite the decresing drug related reportings, it can not be denied that the "drug crisis" has continues through out the years. 

In 2014, the referendum Proposition 47 was passed in the state of california. This measure converted non violent offenses, including drug related offences, from felonies to misdemeanors. The purpose of the measure was to keep offenders out of prison and invest in programs designed to help people in who commited these misdemeanors. [reference] This propositon could be the cause of the decrease in drug related reportings, maybe even in the years the referendum was passed. It would be expected that the referendum only decreased the severness of the penalties rather than the number of instances. However, with this data, it is difficult to say whether the referendum had a big social impact on the conduct and mentality of police officeres leading them to overlook situations involving drugs and focusing there resources on other types of crime.
